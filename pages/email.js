<p>Dear [Name of MP],</p>

<p><em>Insert short introduction about yourself & your geographic connection to the topic.</em></p>

<p>Food is a fundamental human right, and yet it remains to be a privilege for households across Ontario. Food insecurity affects 1 in 8 households, amounting to over 4.4 million Canadians and 1.1 million children living in homes that have difficulty putting food on the table due to low wages and high costs. Throughout the pandemic, we saw a 10-15% increase in visits to Food Banks, with 45% of individuals under the age of 14. In 2021, The Emergency Food Insecurity announced an additional $100-million top-up towards food banks and food organizations. The problem, however, is that <strong>food is not the solution to food insecurity.</strong></p>

<p>I seek social reform through the resolution of income insufficiency. Reducing household food insecurity requires the commitment of public revenue and resources. Food banks have been in place for 40 years, and there is no substantial evidence that food charity can move households out of food insecurity, such that only 1/4 food insecure individuals use these facilities. Research has shown that food insecurity can be reduced through public policies that improve the financial circumstances of low-income households. Pension programs for individuals above 65 years of age introduced a 50% drop in food insecurity, in comparison to those in their 50s. Initiatives such as Saskatchewanâ€™s Social Assistance Reforms reflect the protection that income stability provide to families on a large scale.</p>

<p>As a result, it is my impartial intention that a <strong>Basic Income Guarantee</strong> will be employed, which directly provides families with sustainable solutions. This is not a proposition to remove food banks, nor is it a request to remove their support. This is a motion to reduce the over-reliance on food banks. In a country as rich as ours, it is unacceptable that we face income insufficiency through a lack of fundamental resources.</p>

<p>Within a community of political scientists, we want to see the implementation of a Basic Income Guarantee, through effective and efficient social assistance. This solution will include, but not be limited to:
   <br/><br/> <ol>
        <li>The implementation of a floor income for Ontario citizens.</li>
        <li>A comprehensive, integrated provincial plan for effective social assistance.</li>
        <li>Allocating funds to the research into the dismantling of anti-Black racism in food insecurity.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate the government&#39;s actions to make Ontario a better place. What specific actions will your party take to prioritize the state of equity in the province? How highly is food insecurity prioritized in the government? What is the status of current social assistance programs? We, as a group of political scientists, seek a path towards equity.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>[insert name]<br/>[location]</p>
