<p>
Don&#39;t get it twisted<br/><br/>
This land was made for you and me,<br/>
But it lacks equity, you see<br/><br/>

We did not start from the same place,<br/>
And neither are we of the same race<br/><br/>

How dare your laws be considered fair<br/>
When equality is an illusion in the air<br/><br/>

Our names sound alike and we are pals<br/>
but the difference between us is crucial<br/><br/>

Equality is not equity.<br/>
Equity is not equality.<br/><br/>

In the land of the free,<br/>
and the home of the poor<br/><br/>

We must do better<br/>
We must do more<br/><br/>

Both equity and equality need more awareness<br/>
to push our country towards sustainability<br/>
